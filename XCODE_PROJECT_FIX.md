# Xcode Project File Structure Fix

## Problem
When downloading and unzipping the repository, opening the `.xcodeproj` file in Xcode showed all files with **red marks** (missing file references), preventing the project from being built or edited.

## Root Cause
The source files were incorrectly nested in a `ParkingApp/ParkingApp/` directory structure, while the Xcode project file expected them to be directly in the `ParkingApp/` directory.

**Before (Incorrect):**
```
ParkingApp.xcodeproj/
ParkingApp/
  ParkingApp/          <- Files were here (wrong!)
    *.swift files
    Assets.xcassets/
    ...
```

**After (Correct):**
```
ParkingApp.xcodeproj/
ParkingApp/            <- Files are now here (correct!)
  *.swift files
  Assets.xcassets/
  ...
```

## Solution Applied
All source files, assets, and resources have been moved from the nested `ParkingApp/ParkingApp/` directory to the correct `ParkingApp/` directory.

## What's Fixed
✅ All Swift source files now properly referenced  
✅ Assets.xcassets in correct location  
✅ Info.plist accessible  
✅ GoogleService-Info.plist in place  
✅ All subdirectories (Views, Model, Services, etc.) correctly organized  
✅ Preview Content properly referenced  

## How to Verify
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `ParkingApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Check the Project Navigator - all files should show with **white icons**
4. The project should now build and run successfully

## Files Organization
```
ParkingApp/
├── Assets.xcassets/       # App assets and images
├── Data/                  # Data layer
├── DetailView/            # Detail view components
├── Extensions/            # Swift extensions
├── Model/                 # Data models
├── Preview Content/       # Preview assets
├── Services/              # Firebase and other services
├── SpotsView/             # Parking spots views
├── ViewModel/             # View models
├── Views/                 # Authentication and other views
├── ParkingAppApp.swift    # Main app entry point
├── Info.plist             # App configuration
└── GoogleService-Info.plist  # Firebase configuration
```

## Note
If you previously downloaded this repository and are experiencing issues:
1. Delete the old downloaded version
2. Download/clone the latest version
3. The project should now work correctly in Xcode
